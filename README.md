## Twitch overlay toys

Some stream overlay tools to enhance your twitch streams for your viewers, built to work with [streamer.bot](https://streamer.bot/).
For now there's only one feature, which allows your viewers to use their channel points to open a case with custom rewards defined by you (the streamer) with simple web panel.
Each reward may have custom name, color, image and weight.


### Next to do (in random order)
 - alternative draw animation (wheel of fortune)
 - gif overlay tool (with timer)
 - feature to choose icons for rewards instead of images
